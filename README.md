# Profit-Calculator

This program takes class instances entered in 'main' and calculates how much you'll make if you sell out, 
and how much of your stock you'll need to sell in order to make a specified amount of profit.
If you'd like to use this for your small business, simply make a copy on your local system, swap out the product names, 
prices, etc for your own, and launch the app. If you share this with others, make sure to credit back. I built this from scratch, yo.
